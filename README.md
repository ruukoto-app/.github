## Bio
Ruukoto is a microservice-architected bot that emphasizes a modular system. Despite its complex structure, its primary goal is performance. This organization was created to demonstrate certain aspects of Ruukoto's development and to prove the advantages of such an architecture over the traditional monolithic approach commonly used in Discord bots.
